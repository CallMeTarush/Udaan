# HouseKeeping API

## Running the backend (Housekeeping Folder)
to activate virtualenv on Windows, activate script is in the Scripts folder :

### Backend
```
\path\to\env\Scripts\activate
python manage.py runserver
```

This runs our django server on port 8000,

### Frontend

Just open the ```index.html``` file in the frontend folder

## Functionality

All requested functionality has been added, All routes requested are on the frontend too.  To check all functionality just head over to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ after running the backend and login with ```admin``` and ```password123``` to see all objects made and database relations as well.

## Known Limitations

1. Little to no error handling from api in frontend
2. Bad UX ( Had 0 time xD)
